# GaltonBoardSimulator

This project tries to simulate the physics exhibit in a Galton Board and how the Bell Curve works using Newtonian Physics and Statistical binary method. Future work consists of adding user-interactiveness, such as buttons and sliders for manipulating the Galton Board's environment and attributes.

To start:

Install: pip install pygame, pymunk, pygame_gui, matplotlib, numpy, scipy
